#csvParser
A parser for csv files in C

This is a simple parser for reading csv files for C.

It reads csv files generated by excel or libre-office into a tree like structure,
which allows a user to access the cells in the csv like a 2 dimensional array
using row and column. Currently it only works with standard ascii formated files,
though it should be possible to migrate to unicode.

This repository consists of three files
csvParser.h
csvParser.c

with a third file csvTest.c which can be used as an example and for testing

Code example:

// readCsv reads the file into memory ( a tree like structure )
CsvType *csv = readCsv(argv[1], ',');
uint32_t nRows = csv->numRows;
uint32_t nCols = csv->numCols;
CsvCellType cell = {};
for (int r = 0; r < nRows; r++) {
  for (int c = 0; c < nCols; c++) {
    // getCell returns the contents at r,c
    cell = getCell(csv, r, c);
  }
}

typedef struct CsvCellType {
  // an empty cell has 0 bytes
  uint32_t bytes;
  CellStatusType status; // validity of the cell
  char *cellContents;
} CsvCellType;

the CsvCellRurned struct retured is a copy of the data in the tree.It
    retuns information about the cell,
    such as if it actually was found,
    if it is empty and if it is the last cell in the row.The
            data in the cell is a char *(the number of bytes is also recored)
                exactly was it was in the csv

See csv_Test.c for an example
