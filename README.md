# csvParser
A parser for csv files in C

This is a simple parser for reading csv files for C.

It reads csv files generated by excel or libre-office into a tree like structure,
which allows a user to access the cells in the csv like a 2 dimensional array
using row and column. Currently it only works with standard ascii formated files,
though it should be possible to migrate to unicode.

This repository consists of three files
csvParser.h
csvParser.c

with a third file csvTest.c which can be used as an example and for testing

Code example:
